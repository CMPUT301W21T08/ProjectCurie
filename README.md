# ProjectCurie

## Overview
This is a project for CMPUT 301 - Winter 2021. ProjectCurie is a crowdsourcing app for Android that allows users to create, view, and submit results to experiments. Users can subscribe, view statistics, and comment on experiments. Some experiments may have geolocation enabled in which case users can view geolocation of submitted trials. Users have the option to register a QR code or barcode with the app to serve as a specific trial result for a given experiment. Barcodes can then be scanned from within the app by accessing the user's camera to submit a trial result.
